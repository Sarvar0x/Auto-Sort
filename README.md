This program is useful because it automates file organization on a computer. Instead of manually moving files into different folders, the program sorts them automatically based on their type (for example: documents, images, music, videos, etc.).

It helps in:

Keeping the desktop or selected folder clean and organized.

Saving time by avoiding manual file management.

Quickly finding files since everything is categorized.

Increasing productivity by reducing digital clutter.

In short, this program does the job of a “smart assistant” for file management — it automatically keeps your folders neat and well-structured.
